Plan
----

In 2023, we will focus on Higher Order Company's brand. We will turn our
impressive tech results into polished projects that are used and loved by
developers all around the world. Our immediate goal is to be widely recognized
by the field as a promising tech startup capable of delivering groundbreaking
tech. We won't develop a business plan yet, since we will devote our focus in
quality and adoption. Once Kind, Kindelia and ThreadBender are used by
mathematicians, crypto enthusiasts and developers all around the world, and once
we've stablished a respected name in the market, we will be in a much stronger
position to research ways to profit from our products.

Projects
--------

### Kind

The field of mathematics won't be stablished on pen and paper forever. There is
a growing body of mathematicians attemtping to [digitalization of
mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp-mQ3HxgDE) right now. In a
future, all major theorems and proofs will be available in a giantic ecosystem
of proofs that you can import, modify and publish, just like package managers of
programming like JavaScript's npm or Rust's cargo.

For that to happen, we need something: a proof checker. All stablished proof
checkers; Coq, Lean, Agda and Idris; are extremely slow and have a sub-par
UI/UX. Thanks to HVM, Kind is, by far, the [fastest proof
checker](https://github.com/kindelia/functional-benchmarks) in the world. It is
not the **best** though, as it is missing many features such as a package
manager, a totality checker, tactics, among others. We will make Kind-Lang the
best proof-checker in the world. Once we do, we will be in a privileged position
to dominate this market that will be huge in the future.

### Kindelia

The blockchain space is flooded with layer 1 smart-contract networks, but all of
them are extremely underwhelming in several aspects, from code quality, to
scalability, to security. While there are some inovative projects, it is hard to
name a peer-to-peer computer that is just so neutral and well built that it
could be part of Linux's kernel one day. Kindelia will be that.

With no premine, a computational throughput that is 500x higher than Ethereum
(without relying on added centralization, or complex crypto promitives!), an
ultra-efficient state storage that allows for real-time transactions,
unbreakable security backed by mathematical proofs on the contract level, and a
collection of high-quality decisions that make it as robust as all our projects,
we believe Kindelia has everything it takes to become the Bitcoin of the
peer-to-peer computer, and host massive metaverses one day.

### ThreadBender

Since around 2006, processors are getting increasingly more parallel; AMD's next
ThreadRipper CPU has 96 cores; yet, software isn't catching up with that trend.
Most programming languages in use today are still single-threaded by default.
While some of them offer features capable of parallelizing software, doing so is
extremely hard and expensive, due to the overwhelming complexity of concurrent
synchronization and hard-to-debug non-deterministic behaviors.

Thanks to HVM's powerful parallelization primitives - beta-reduction,
pattern-matching, equational rewrites - ThreadBender is capable of transpiling
high-level languages such as Python, JavaScript and Go to HVM, allowing
developers to take existing code in languages they're already used to, and run
that code in all the cores available. Once we have CPUs with thousands of cores,
the pressure to parallelize software will be enormous. The programming industry
is due to a revolution on how we write algorithms. By being as simple as Python
and as parallel as CUDA, ThreadBender has everything to lead this revolution.

Roadmap
-------

### Q1 2023

We will close this seed round and start the hiring process.

### Q2 2023 - Q1 2024

We will develop the first production-ready versions of HVM, Kindelia,
Kind-Lang and ThreadBender. Meanwhile, we will be planning and 

### Jan 1, 2024

We will release ...
