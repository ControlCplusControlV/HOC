Kindelia Genesis Token is a crypto-currency deployed by Kindelia Foundation on
the Kindelia blockchain. It isn't part of the network, but just a standard
smart-contract. It includes a 5% premined supply, plus a 95% mined supply,
following the same emission curve as Bitcoin, including 4-yearly halvings. The
5% premined supply was granted to the Kindelia Foundation, who distributed it
for private investors, grants and community airdrops. The community airdrops
were performed on public Discord calls open for all the community, and defined
based on several metricts, including participation, knowledge about the project,
past contributions. All AirDrops are listed transparently on the /airdrops
directory. BRL conversions use the following projections:

Top #200 = R$    520,000,000 mcap = R$ 0.01 / KGT
Top #100 = R$  2,200,000,000 mcap = R$ 0.05 / KGT
Top  #50 = R$  5,782,000,000 mcap = R$ 0.13 / KGT
Top  #10 = R$ 53,154,000,000 mcap = R$ 1.26 / KGT
